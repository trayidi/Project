# Project
The first cloud project
We are going to create a special website where people who want to start a business (founders) and people who want to invest money (investors) can come together. On our website, founders can put up their creative startup ideas for every investor to see. Investors can easily log in to the website and find a list of these ideas from different founders.
This makes it easy for investors to look at many interesting concepts from people who are just starting out. Our website is like a welcoming place where people with awesome ideas can connect with others who want to help and invest in exciting new projects. It's a friendly space where creativity meets support, bringing together those with cool ideas and those eager to be part of something exciting and new.
